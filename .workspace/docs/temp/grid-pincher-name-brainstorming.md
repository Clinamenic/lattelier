## App Core Concept Summary

The application allows users to:
- Generate regular grid patterns (square, triangular, hexagonal)
- Add "wells" (attraction/repulsion points) that warp and distort the grid
- Create organic, flowing patterns from geometric foundations
- Export high-resolution graphics for art and design

Key concepts: distortion, warping, attraction/repulsion, fields, tessellation, deformation, organic geometry

## User-Proposed Name Analysis: "Lattelier"

### Concept
**Lattelier** - Portmanteau of "lattice" + "atelier"
- *Rationale*: Combines the technical concept of lattice structures with the artistic sophistication of an atelier (French for workshop/studio)
- *Strength*: Elegant, memorable, balances technical and artistic positioning perfectly
- *Pronunciation*: Lat-tel-ee-ay (French-inspired) or Lat-tell-yer (anglicized)

### SEO & Brand Availability Analysis (October 2025)

**CONFLICT IDENTIFIED**: ❌

**Existing Usage:**
- **Lattelier Fashion Brand** - NYC-based clothing label founded in 2020
  - Website: Likely using lattelier.com or similar primary domain
  - Market: Women's and men's modern sophisticated fashion
  - Brand positioning: "Elevating everyday clothing into extraordinary pieces"
  - Industry: Fashion/apparel (different from software, but still creates conflicts)

**SEO Implications:**
1. **Search Competition**: Fashion brand dominates search results for "Lattelier"
2. **Brand Confusion**: Users searching for the app would encounter fashion brand results
3. **Diluted Identity**: Hard to establish unique brand presence
4. **Marketing Cost**: Would require significant SEO investment to differentiate from fashion brand

**Legal/Trademark Considerations:**
- Potential trademark conflicts (fashion brand may have registered trademark)
- Different industry sectors (fashion vs. software) provides some protection, but:
  - Modern trademark law considers "likelihood of confusion" across sectors
  - Digital products increasingly blur category boundaries
  - Risk of cease-and-desist letters or legal disputes

**Domain Availability:**
- `lattelier.com` - Likely taken by fashion brand ❌
- `lattelier.io` - Unknown, but risky even if available
- `lattelier.app` - Would not overcome brand confusion issues

**Social Media Handles:**
- Likely taken or would cause confusion with fashion brand
- Instagram, Twitter/X particularly problematic for brand differentiation

### Recommendation: ⚠️ **AVOID**

While "Lattelier" is conceptually perfect for the application, the existing fashion brand presence creates too many risks:
- Legal exposure
- SEO challenges
- Brand confusion
- Marketing inefficiency

- Risk: May still be too similar for comfort

---

### Original Top Recommendation: **Lattice Flow**

*If moving away from the "atelier" concept entirely*, **Lattice Flow** remains the strongest choice:

*Reasoning*: 
- Balances technical precision ("lattice") with creative fluidity ("flow")
- Two words, easy to say and remember
- Works as both noun ("I made this in Lattice Flow") and suggests action ("watch the lattice flow")
- Professional enough for design studios, accessible enough for hobbyists
- Strong visual brand potential (flowing grid patterns as logo)
- Unique in the creative tools space
